This class, VLSI Design, taought by Dr. Sechen, was the most intense class I've taken at UTD (even more than the following class 7325, only because it was online). This class went in depth on NMOS and PMOS transistors, and how they were used to create CMOS gates. Our assignments walked us through the process of a chip deisgn, from rtl to layout, and we learned how to use a variety of tools such as Cadence Designer, innovus (STA software). For my project, I created nearly 2 dozen gates (scripting something in bash really helped with automating much of the work needed to be done and redone).
