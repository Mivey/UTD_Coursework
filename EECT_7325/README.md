This class, Advanced VLSI Design is a continuation of EECT 6325, and also taought by Dr. Sechen. The project here uses 7nm to implement the gates, but due to licencing restrictions by Cadence, placement & routing (Innovous) is not available for use. This means the gates were placed and routed by hand. To help keep my sanity, I designed a 12 bit Carry select adder. To help the CSA, I broke it down to indivitual elements, as seen in the rtl code carry_sel.v. Those elements were then created in Cadence, verified using [tool] LVS and then slowly pieced together so that I could pickup and connect one bit at a time. 
As an aside, it was interesting to get a visual of how much smaller 7nm was vs 65nm when comparing a simple inverter (I forgot to save the screenshot).
