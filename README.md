# UT Dallas Graduate Engineering Projects

A collection of graduate-level engineering projects focusing on **FPGA Design**, **High-Level Synthesis (HLS)**, **VLSI**, and **Functional Verification (UVM)**. This repository also hosts the ongoing development of my Master's Thesis on **Edge AI Acceleration using AMD Versal ACAPs**.

## Overview
In each course folder, you will find:
* 📄 **Course Syllabus** & Learning Objectives
* 💻 **Source Code** (RTL, C++, Python)
* 📊 **Project Documentation** & Simulation Results

## Featured Work
* **Master's Thesis:** Design Space Exploration & Memory Hierarchy Optimization for Llama 2 Inference.
* **6325 VLSI Design:** Full RTL-to-GDSII flow implementation - inclucing the use of Innovous for P&R - using the 65nm process.
* **7325 Advanced VLSI Design:** Full RTL-to-GDSII flow implementation using the 7nm process.
* **6370 Design and Analysis of Reconfigurable Systems:** Weekly homework projects implemented on the DE1-SoC as well as the sobel filter, written in SystemVerilog and Vitis HLS.
* **7V81 Special Topics in Digital Systems - Functional Verification:** SystemVerilog/UVM testbench of an ALU.
